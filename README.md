## Rules

  - You can chose to play with 2-7 players, each additional player besides yourself is a simulated opponent, which will make random moves throughout the game.
  
  - Each player is dealt 5 cards, unless there are less than four players, in which each player will be dealt seven.
  
  - The user will always have the first turn. They are able to select a card from their deck to fish for, as well as a player to fish from.
  
  - If the selected opponent possesses the card fished for, the card will then be given to the user, and the game will proceed.
  
  - If the opponent does not have the card, the user will be given a card from the deck and their turn will end.
  
  - When a player gets four cards of the same number or face from each suit, it is considered a "set". The player with the most sets wins the game.
  
  - The game continues until the deck runs out of cards, or until every set has been completed.
